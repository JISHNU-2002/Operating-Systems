## Banker's Algorithm

- The Banker's algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems

- The Banker's algorithm ensures that resources are allocated in a safe manner, meaning no deadlock will occur, by checking each resource request to see if it leaves enough resources available to satisfy potential future requests


## CPU Scheduling

- CPU scheduling determines which process gets to use the CPU at any given time

- CPU scheduling algorithms like Round Robin, Shortest Job Next (SJN) or Priority Scheduling decide the order of process execution, aiming to maximize CPU utilization, throughput, and fairness

## Semaphore

- A semaphore is a synchronization tool used to control access to shared resources in a multi-process or multi-threaded environment

## System Call

- System calls are interface functions provided by the operating system that allow user-level processes to request services from the kernel

## Disk Scheduling

- Disk scheduling algorithms manage the order in which I/O requests are serviced by the disk drive
- Disk scheduling algorithms like FCFS (First-Come, First-Served), SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First), SCAN, or C-SCAN determine the most efficient order to minimize seek time and maximize throughput, improving overall disk performance

## Memory Partitioning

- Memory partitioning divides physical memory into several partitions to accommodate multiple processes

## Shared Memory

- Shared memory allows multiple processes to access the same region of memory simultaneously, providing an efficient means of inter-process communication
